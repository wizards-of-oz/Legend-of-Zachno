# crawling_dungeons
A couple of internet friends working on a dungeon crawler in Python using PyGame and Tkinter modules.
After much deliberation this game is called 'Legend of Zachno'
Its is basically an oldskool Dungeon Crawler. You play Zachno, a lonely monster, fed up with having to live in a damp, dark dungeon, longing for fresh air and the light of day.

In order to reach that you will have to move up 20 levels of dungeon, unfortunately human outsiders are invading the same dungeon, looking for monsters to kill
You can fight, cast spells and set traps, all this stuff you will have to find, and killing the so-called 'heroes' will
of course give you XP for levelling up

Controls:
- The cursor keys move Zachno around, bumping into enemies starts fighting.
- Number keys operate the inventory
- Space bar pauses the game so you have time to come up with a strategy, you will not be able to move, but can use the inventory
